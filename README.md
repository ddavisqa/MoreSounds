SoundScrape
==============

**SoundScrape** makes it easy to download artists from SoundCloud, Bandcamp, and Mixcloud—even tracks that don't have public download links. It automatically creates ID3 tags as well (including album art), which is handy.

This version has been modernized to run on Python 3.12+ and uses `yt-dlp` for robust Mixcloud support.

## Setup & Installation

This project is managed with `uv`.

First, install `uv`:
```bash
pip install uv
```

Next, clone the repository and set up the virtual environment:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Miserlou/SoundScrape.git
cd SoundScrape
uv sync
```

### SoundCloud API Key

To download from SoundCloud, you must provide your own API key.

1.  Create a file named `.env` in the root of the project.
2.  Add your SoundCloud OAuth Token to the file like this:

    ```
    SOUNDCLOUD_CLIENT_ID="YOUR_TOKEN_HERE"
    ```

## Usage

To run `soundscrape`, use `uv run`:

```bash
uv run soundscrape rabbit-i-am
```
And you're done! Hooray! Files are stored as mp3s in the format **Artist name - Track title.mp3**.

You can also use the `-n` argument to only download a certain number of songs.

```bash
uv run soundscrape rabbit-i-am -n 3
```

Sets
-------

Soundscrape can also download sets, but you have to include the full URL of the set you want to download:

```bash
soundscrape https://soundcloud.com/vsauce-awesome/sets/awesome
```

Groups
--------

Soundscrape can also download tracks from SoundCloud groups with the *-g* argument.

```bash
soundscrape chopped-and-screwed -gn 2
```

Tracks
--------

Soundscrape can also download specific tracks with *-t*:

```bash
soundscrape foolsgoldrecs -t danny-brown-dip
```

or with just the straight URL:

```bash
soundscrape https://soundcloud.com/foolsgoldrecs/danny-brown-dip
```

Likes
--------

Soundscrape can also download all of an Artist's Liked items with *-l*:

```bash
soundscrape troyboi -l
```

or with just the straight URL:

```bash
soundscrape https://soundcloud.com/troyboi/likes
```

High-Quality Downloads Only
--------

By default, SoundScrape will try to rip everything it can. However, if you only want to download tracks that have an official download available (which are typically at a higher-quality 320kbps bitrate), you can use the *-d* argument.

```bash
soundscrape sly-dogg -d
```

Keep Preview Tracks
--------

By default, SoundScrape will skip the 30-second preview tracks that SoundCloud now provides. You can choose to keep these preview snippets with the *-k* argument.

```bash
soundscrape chromeo -k
```

Folders
--------

By default, SoundScrape aims to act like _wget_, downloading in place in the current directory. With the *-f* argument, however, SoundScrape acts more like a download manager and sorts songs into the following format:

```
./ARTIST_NAME - ALBUM_NAME/SONG_NUMBER - SONG_TITLE.mp3
```

It will also skip previously downloaded tracks.

```bash
soundscrape murdercitydevils -f
```

Bandcamp
--------

SoundScrape can also pull down albums from Bandcamp. For Bandcamp pages, use the *-b* argument along with an artist's username or a specific URL. It only downloads one album at a time. This works with all of the other arguments, except *-d* as Bandcamp streams only come at one bitrate, as far as I can tell.

Note: Currently, when using the *-n* argument, the limit is evaluated for each album separately.

```bash
soundscrape warsaw -b -f
```

This also works for non-Bandcamp URLs that are hosted on Bandcamp:

```bash
soundscrape -b http://music.monstercat.com/
```

Note that the full URL must be included.

Mixcloud
--------

SoundScrape can now robustly download sets and user profiles from Mixcloud, powered by `yt-dlp`.

Because Mixcloud now uses encrypted streaming, the original experimental downloader no longer works. The new implementation is significantly more reliable and supports full user profiles, not just individual tracks.

To download a Mixcloud set:
```bash
uv run soundscrape https://www.mixcloud.com/DjMoneyJ/x-ecutioners-built-from-scratch/
```

To download all of a user's uploads (up to the `-n` limit):
```bash
uv run soundscrape https://www.mixcloud.com/corenewsuploads/
```

Audiomack
--------

Just for fun, SoundScrape can also download individual songs from Audiomack. Not that you'd ever want to.

```bash
soundscrape -a http://www.audiomack.com/song/bottomfeedermusic/top-shottas
```

MusicBed
--------

For some strange reason, it also works for MusicBed.com. Thanks @brachna for this feature.

```bash
soundscrape https://www.musicbed.com/albums/be-still/2828
```

Opening Files
--------

As a convenience method, SoundScrape can automatically _'open'_ files that it downloads. This uses your system's 'open' command for file associations.

```bash
soundscrape lorn -of
```

Issues
-------

There's probably a lot more that can be done to improve this. Please file issues if you find them!
